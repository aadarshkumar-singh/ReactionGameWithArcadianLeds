* Programming rules (may be deleted in the final release of the file)
* ===================================================================
*
* 1. Naming conventions:
*    - Prefix of your module in front of every function and static data. 
*    - Scope _ for public and __ for private functions / data / types, e.g. 
*       Public:  void CONTROL_straightPark_Init();
*       Private: static void CONTROL__calcDistance();
*       Public:  typedef enum {RED, GREEN, YELLOW} CONTROL_color_t
*    - Own type definitions e.g. for structs or enums get a postfix _t
*    - #define's and enums are written in CAPITAL letters
* 2. Code structure
*    - Be aware of the scope of your modules and functions. Provide only functions which belong to your module to your files
*    - Prepare your design before starting to code
*    - Implement the simple most solution (Too many if then else nestings are an indicator that you have not properly analysed your task)
*    - Avoid magic numbers, use enums and #define's instead
*    - Make sure, that all error conditions are properly handled
*    - If your module provides data structures, which are required in many other files, it is recommended to place them in a file_type.h file
*	  - If your module contains configurable parts, is is recommended to place these in a file_config.h|.c file
* 3. Data conventions
*    - Minimize the scope of data (and functions)
*    - Global data is not allowed outside of the signal layer (in case a signal layer is part of your design)
*    - All static objects have to be placed in a valid linker sections
*    - Data which is accessed in more than one task has to be volatile and needs to be protected (e.g. by using messages or semaphores)
*    - Do not mix signed and unsigned data in the same operation
* 4. Documentation
*    - Use self explaining function and variable names
*    - Use proper indentation
*    - Provide Javadoc / Doxygen compatible comments in your header file and C-File
*    		- Every  File has to be documented in the header
*			- Every function parameter and return value must be documented, the valid range needs to be specified
*     		- Logical code blocks in the C-File must be commented
*    - For a detailed list of doxygen commands check http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html 
* 5. Qualification
*    - Perform and document design and code reviews for every module
*    - Provide test specifications for every module (focus on error conditions)
